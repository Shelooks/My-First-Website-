            From the previous report about the poached rhinos, here is a further update on the news about the implementation taken to protect more rhinos from being poached. The natural reserve management decided to cut the horns of each remaining rhino.
            This is done to protect the rhinos but again it brings a lot of questions into people's mind since their horns were for defense mechanism. 
            A lot are wondering as how are the rhinos suppose to protect themselves from other animal attacks.
